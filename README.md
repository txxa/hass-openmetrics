_Integration to integrate with OpenMetrics and Prometheus exposition format providers._

The [OpenMetrics specification](https://github.com/OpenObservability/OpenMetrics/blob/main/specification/OpenMetrics.md) defines a standard for exposing metrics in a text-based format. This integration supports both the OpenMetrics format and the Prometheus exposition format, which is a widely adopted format for exposing metrics. The library used to process the data is coming from the [Python client repository](https://github.com/prometheus/client_python/blob/master/prometheus_client/) of Prometheus.

Example applications that provide metrics data in supported formats:
- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)
- [Thanos](https://thanos.io/)
- [Cortex](https://cortexmetrics.io/)
- [Node Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter)
- [cAdvisor](https://github.com/google/cadvisor)
- [Blackbox Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter)

This integration allows you to monitor various metrics from OpenMetrics and Prometheus exposition format providers within Home Assistant.

For the best experience, try to keep both the integration and metrics providers updated to their latest compatible versions.

## Development and maintenance

I basically created this integration for my personal purpose. As it fulfils all my current needs I won't develop it further for now.\
However, as long as I am using this integration in my Home Assistant setup I will maintain it actively.
